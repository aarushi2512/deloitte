# Data & Analytics Internship â€“ Deloitte, Mumbai (Summer 2025)

## Introduction
During my internship at Deloitte, Mumbai, I worked on multiple analytics-driven projects focusing on business intelligence, data engineering, visualization, and automation. This experience provided hands-on exposure to real-world client challenges and showcased the measurable value of data-driven strategies.

## Key Contributions

### Data Analytics & Engineering
- Developed interactive business dashboards with **Power BI** for real-time KPI tracking and stakeholder reporting.
- Queried, extracted, and prepared datasets from company databases using **SQL** for cross-functional analysis.
- Analyzed large-scale datasets to uncover actionable insights relevant to business objectives.

### Data Visualization & Storytelling
- Designed **D3.js** storyboards to transform complex analytics outcomes into engaging, executive-ready visual narratives.
- Created cluster-scatter plots to visually communicate customer segmentation outcomes to both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Automation & Custom Solutions
- Built a **Python** tool to calculate accurate road distances (km) for truck drivers using latitude and longitude, streamlining logistics planning.
- Automated metadata extraction from **SAP tables** by scraping LeanX for column names and generating data dictionaries, improving analytics project efficiency.

### Machine Learning & Segmentation
- Applied unsupervised algorithms (KMeans, DBSCAN) to organize and cluster customer data, isolating frequent buyer cohorts and emerging market segments.
- Visualized clustered segments and key trends as scatter plots and included them in dashboards for targeted business recommendations.

### GenAI, Automation & Modern Tooling
- Engaged in prompt engineering and practical applications of **Generative AI** to enhance automation and data interpretation.
- Employed **Alteryx** for ETL/data preparation, supporting streamlined analytics workflows.
- Utilized **Git**, **Postman**, and APIs for version control, API testing, and integrated data connectivity.
